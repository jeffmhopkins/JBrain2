"""Layer-2 location firewall for the EMR importer (docs/plans/EMR_IMPORT_PLAN.md §3.6).

The health firewall on this path has NO domain-floor backstop: `domain_floor`
only ratchets a *general* note (`extracted_domain == "general"`), so on a health
note an `address`/`geo` fact would stay `health` rather than being pushed to the
`location` domain. The firewall therefore rests on two deliberate layers so a
single parser miss can't plant location whereabouts in the health domain:

  Layer 1 — the parsers strip postal addresses and geo, emitting only facility /
            provider NAMES (never an `address`/`geo` fact).
  Layer 2 — this guard, run at integration time BEFORE a candidate is lowered to
            an IntegrationIntent: any fact whose predicate is in the location-lock
            set, on a health EMR entity, is routed to a `low_confidence`
            (`subkind=firewall_address`) review card and NEVER committed.

The lock set is deliberately the UNION of the Located-facet predicates
(`address`, `geo`) and the extraction floor dict (`geocoordinates`, `latitude`,
`longitude`, `gpscoordinates`) — because `geo` is NOT in the floor dict, a
floor-only guard would let a stray `geo` fact slip through. Building the set as
this explicit union closes that gap (§3.6).
